An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pondâ€”
Splash! Silence again.

Relaxing

Picking up pebbles
Or seashells strewn on soft sand
Pure relaxation.

A plane flies over,
you dream of being on it.
Ideas flourish.

Babies
HAIKU:
You're so cute, but why
Should I write a haiku for you?
You can't even read.

TOPIC:
Stinky Cheese
HAIKU:
I love you so much,
But your love of cheese is wrong.
The smell makes me gag.

This game is too hard
I can't pass the first level
Someone help me please
